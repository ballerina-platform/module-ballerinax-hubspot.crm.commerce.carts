## Overview

[HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com) is an AI-powered customer relationship management (CRM) platform.

The `ballerinax/hubspot.crm.commerce.carts` package offers APIs to connect and interact with [HubSpot CRM Commerce Carts API](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/reference/api/crm/commerce/carts) endpoints, specifically based on [HubSpot REST API](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/reference/api).

> **Note:** This package may be changed in the future based on the HubSpot API changes, since it is currently under development and is subject to change based on testing and feedback. By using this package, you are agreeing to accept any future changes that might occur and understand the risk associated with testing an unstable API. Refer to the [HubSpot Developer Terms](https://legal.hubspot.com/developer-terms) & [Developer Beta Terms](https://legal.hubspot.com/developerbetaterms) for more information.

## Setup guide

To use the HubSpot Carts connector, you must have access to the HubSpot API through a HubSpot developer account and a HubSpot App under it. Therefore you need to register for a developer account at HubSpot if you don't have one already.

### Step 1: Create/Login to a HubSpot Developer Account

If you have an account already, go to the [HubSpot developer portal](https://app.hubspot.com/)

If you don't have a HubSpot Developer Account you can sign up to a free account [here](https://developers.hubspot.com/get-started)

### Step 2 (Optional): Create a Developer Test Account

Within app developer accounts, you can create a [developer test account](https://developers.hubspot.com/beta-docs/getting-started/account-types#developer-test-accounts) under your account to test apps and integrations without affecting any real HubSpot data.

> **Note:** These accounts are only for development and testing purposes. In production you should not use Developer Test Accounts.

1. Go to Test accounts section from the left sidebar.

   ![Test Account](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerinax-hubspot.crm.commerce.carts/main/docs/setup/resources/test-account.png)

2. Click on the `Create developer test account` button on the top right corner.

   ![Test Account](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerinax-hubspot.crm.commerce.carts/main/docs/setup/resources/create-test-account.png)

3. In the pop-up window, provide a name for the test account and click on the `Create` button.

   ![Test Account](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerinax-hubspot.crm.commerce.carts/main/docs/setup/resources/create-account.png)

4. You will see the newly created test account in the list of test accounts.

   ![Test Account](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerinax-hubspot.crm.commerce.carts/main/docs/setup/resources/test-account-portal.png)

### Step 3: Create a HubSpot App

1. Now navigate to the `Apps` section from the left sidebar and click on the `Create app` button on the top right corner.

   ![Test Account](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerinax-hubspot.crm.commerce.carts/main/docs/setup/resources/create-app.png)

2. Provide a public app name and description for your app.

   ![Test Account](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerinax-hubspot.crm.commerce.carts/main/docs/setup/resources/app-name-desc.png)

### Step 4: Setup Authentication

1. Move to the `Auth` tab.

   ![Test Account](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerinax-hubspot.crm.commerce.carts/main/docs/setup/resources/config-auth.png)

2. In the `Scopes` section, add the following scopes for your app using the `Add new scopes` button.
   - `crm.objects.carts.read`
   - `crm.objects.carts.write`

   ![Test Account](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerinax-hubspot.crm.commerce.carts/main/docs/setup/resources/add-scopes.png)

3. In the `Redirect URL` section, add the redirect URL for your app. This is the URL where the user will be redirected after the authentication process. You can use localhost for testing purposes. Then hit the `Create App` button.

   ![Test Account](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerinax-hubspot.crm.commerce.carts/main/docs/setup/resources/redirect-url.png)

### Step 5: Get the Client ID and Client Secret

Navigate to the `Auth` tab and you will see the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` for your app. Make sure to save these values.

![Test Account](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerinax-hubspot.crm.commerce.carts/main/docs/setup/resources/client-id-secret.png)

### Step 6: Setup Authentication Flow

Before proceeding with the Quickstart, ensure you have obtained the Access Token using the following steps:

1. Create an authorization URL using the following format:

   ```
   https://app.hubspot.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>&scope=<YOUR_SCOPES>&redirect_uri=<YOUR_REDIRECT_URI>
   ```

   Replace the `<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>`, `<YOUR_REDIRECT_URI>`, and `<YOUR_SCOPES>` with your specific value.

2. Paste it in the browser and select your developer test account to intall the app when prompted.

   ![Test Account](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerinax-hubspot.crm.commerce.carts/main/docs/setup/resources/hubspot-oauth-consent-screen.png)

3. A code will be displayed in the browser. Copy the code.

4. Run the following curl command. Replace the `<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>`, `<YOUR_REDIRECT_URI>`, and `<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>` with your specific value. Use the code you received in the above step 3 as the `<CODE>`.

   - Linux/macOS

     ```bash
     curl --request POST \
     --url https://api.hubapi.com/oauth/v1/token \
     --header 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
     --data 'grant_type=authorization_code&code=<CODE>&redirect_uri=<YOUR_REDIRECT_URI>&client_id=<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>&client_secret=<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>'
     ```
   - Windows

     ```bash
     curl --request POST ^
     --url https://api.hubapi.com/oauth/v1/token ^
     --header 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' ^
     --data 'grant_type=authorization_code&code=<CODE>&redirect_uri=<YOUR_REDIRECT_URI>&client_id=<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>&client_secret=<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>'
     ```

   This command will return the access token necessary for API calls.

   ```json
   {
     "token_type": "bearer",
     "refresh_token": "<Refresh Token>",
     "access_token": "<Access Token>",
     "expires_in": 1800
   }
   ```

5. Store the access token securely for use in your application.

## Quickstart

To use the `HubSpot CRM Commerce Carts` connector in your Ballerina application, update the `.bal` file as follows:

### Step 1: Import the module

Import the `hubspot.crm.commerce.carts` module and `oauth2` module.

```ballerina
import ballerinax/hubspot.crm.commerce.carts as hscarts;
import ballerina/oauth2;
```

### Step 2: Instantiate a new connector

1. Instantiate a `hscarts:ConnectionConfig` with the obtained credentials and initialize the connector with it.

    ```ballerina
    configurable string clientId = ?;
    configurable string clientSecret = ?;
    configurable string refreshToken = ?;

    final hscarts:ConnectionConfig config = {
        auth : {
            clientId,
            clientSecret,
            refreshToken,
            credentialBearer: oauth2:POST_BODY_BEARER
        }
    };

    final hscarts:Client hubspot = check new (config);
    ```

2. Create a `Config.toml` file and, configure the obtained credentials in the above steps as follows:

   ```toml
    clientId = <Client Id>
    clientSecret = <Client Secret>
    refreshToken = <Refresh Token>
   ```

### Step 3: Invoke the connector operation

Now, utilize the available connector operations. A sample use case is shown below.

#### Create a new Cart

```ballerina
public function main() returns error? {
   hscarts:SimplePublicObjectInputForCreate payload = {
      "properties": {
        "hs_source_store": "Dog Cafe - Italy",
        "hs_total_price": "500",
        "hs_currency_code": "USD",
        "hs_tax": "36.25",
        "hs_tags": "donuts, bagels"
      }
    };

    hscarts:SimplePublicObject response =  check hubspot->/carts.post(payload = payload);
}
```
