## Overview

[HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com/our-story) is a customer platform with all the software, integrations, and resources users need to connect thier marketing, sales, and customer service.

The `hubspot.crm.commerce.carts` package offers APIs to connect and interact with [CRM Commerce Carts API](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/reference/api/crm/commerce/carts) endpoints, specifically based on HubSpot API v3.

>**_NOTE:_**             
This package may be changed in the future based on the HubSpot API changes, since it is currently under development and is subject to change based on testing and feedback. By using this package, you are agreeing to accept any future changes that might occur and understand the risk associated with testing an unstable API.
